<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## :monocle_face: About The Project


### Motivation
In Singapore, there is no one-stop portal for lost-and-found pets. Posting on the different pet forums and notifying all the different relevant authorities may be inconvenient as it is hard to keep track of so many different forums, social media groups and websites. We hope to allow pet owners to follow a standard and easy-to-follow procedure to list out and update relevant information so that it is easier for the public to help keep a lookout for them. We also want to allow lost petâ€™s information to be automatically checked against the data of our local animal shelters and SPCA and provide a platform to report abuse, illnesses of pets to relevant authorities. 

### Features
